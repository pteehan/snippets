# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# put tests in a folder called tests/ or test_integrations/ or something
# it should have the form:
#
# def test_foo():
#   assert 1 == 2
