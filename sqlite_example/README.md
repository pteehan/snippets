# insights-analysis-adhoc

Contains code and scripts for small analysis projects.  Large projects should get their own repositories e.g. insights-analysis-dubai.

Conventions:

- Each project should have its own folder.  Try to keep things at one level of hierarchy and use descriptive names.
- Each folder should have a README.md file that explains the contents of the folder
- The README.md should include instructions for running the code, including dependencies that need to be installed
- If possible, make the code installable and runnable with a single script, so the work can be easily reproduced
